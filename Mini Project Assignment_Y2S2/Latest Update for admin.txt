--- ADDITIONAL ---
css,js haven't completely separate
--AJAX--
some still working on it
searching
paging
filtering


added one field IsArchived bool to user (for user management purpose)
created a Shared layout only for admin




UPDATE--
tried to combine user collection and admin collection into one collection (xy)
-to ensure the role works well, manually type in the field 
-ensure sucure (password must be hashed)
-admin collection will still keep it for future reference(maybe deleted afterward once done the setting up)

-unarchive user fuction not yet test
--> if this works, user login page (for archived user) need to be inform that 
"Your account is now being archived, please contact administrtor for assisstance" and 
a feedback box should be provided that included admin email (contact us page) for user to contact admin directly

eg. Situation:
If IsArchived: false --> Login Successful
If IsArchived: true  --> Login Failed (Custom Message Triggered)


** IMPORTANCE **
Actual Role (for filter purpose)
i. All
ii. Admin
iii. Student
